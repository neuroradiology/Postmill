# ![](docs/assets/postmill-128.png) Postmill

**Postmill** is a free, web-based, social link aggregator with voting and
threaded comments. It is built on the [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) framework.
Any similarities between this software and that of a large community symbolised
by an alien logo are purely coincidental.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.1 with the curl, gd, iconv, intl, json, mbstring, PDO_PGSQL and xml
  extensions.
* PostgreSQL >= 9.4
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

Postmill should be able to run under any Unix environment. It has been tested to
work under Linux, macOS, and Windows 10's Linux subsystem. Running directly on
Windows may work, but is unsupported.

## Documentation

[Read the documentation][wiki] in the wiki.

## Support

We have a [support board][support] and a [Matrix channel][matrix] where you can
ask for help and support.

## Reporting issues

* Bugs and suggestions on how to improve existing functionality should be
  reported on the [issue tracker][issues].
* Feature requests are no longer acceptable on the issue tracker--I will not do
  free work for you.
* Support questions do not belong on the issue tracker. Use the aforementioned
  public support channels.

## Contributions

You are always welcome to submit merge requests for bug fixes, improvements,
documentation, translations, and so on.

If you want to contribute a new feature, you should start an issue on the issue
tracker to gauge the possibility of it being merged. A feature that's outside
the scope of the software is likely to be rejected. We don't want hurt feelings,
so please just ask beforehand.

## Contact

You can email emma1312@protonmail.ch to discuss something in private with the
creator of the software. **Do not email me for asking for support**--use the
public support channels instead.
